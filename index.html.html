               <b>While many space horror games will focus on combat with aliens, REDROOMS tells a decidedly more grounded story. The game casts you as an astronaut who's sent to check out a battleship ship that lost radio connection , tasked with figuring out what happened to them all. 
                 its slow pace builds up the sheer terror of classic horror Games, REDROOMS emphasizes a sense of existential loneliness that invokes a different kind of creeping dread.
                    to create cosmic terror by casting players as lone explorers navigating an inhospitable universe. It's harder to do so when you're playing as a non-human character, but REDROOMS proves that it's still possible. In this spooky adventure, you'll play as V.A.L.E, an A.I. bounty hunter entrapped on the red planet mars in the most secure prison on the planet you have been given a option though the red planet forever or the abandoned Torment.
                  Unexplained phenomena occurred at Torment Battle crusier. On the night of August 7th 2082, the Crew witnessed bright lights in the sky that moved at a breakneck speed over the Torment
                 RED ROOMS is a sci-fic horror set on the abandoned space carrier The Torment, Built on the New Unreal engine 5.0  
                 REDROOMS will be supported by XBOX PS5 and PC with simple First person shooter controls
                    in RR we really focus on the old horror aspect of games not just jump scares you sense are coming but a real feel of the Silence, <b>
